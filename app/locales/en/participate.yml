  h3: Bugs, features and development
  p-intro:
  - First of all, know that <strong>@:data.color.soft does not develop</strong>.
    With a few exceptions, we only slightly adapt software
    existing to offer them to the public.
  - Before contacting us, it is therefore important to know if your contributions
    really concern the adaptations made for projects @:data.color.soft
    or the original software.
  - It will be more effective to report a bug or suggest improvements to the
    code, if you do so from the respective development sites. For
    everything else (translation, graphics, writing, system administrationâ€¦)
    do not hesitate to contact us.
